# Placeholder Images

This directory contains placeholder images used throughout the application.

Required placeholder images:
- `shop-placeholder.png`: Used as a placeholder for shop images when loading or when no image is available
- `product-placeholder.png`: Used as a placeholder for product images when loading or when no image is available

These images should be optimized for web use (compressed, appropriate dimensions) to ensure fast loading times.
