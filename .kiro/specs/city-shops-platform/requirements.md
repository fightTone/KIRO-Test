# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a comprehensive online shopping platform that represents shops available within a specific city. The platform will be built as a React web application with a FastAPI backend and MySQL database. The system will allow users to browse shops and products by category, manage shopping carts, and provide different experiences for regular customers versus shop owners. The platform emphasizes a minimalist UI design with built-in React styling and light/dark mode support.
